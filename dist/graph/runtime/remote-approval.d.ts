/**
 * Remote approval gate (graph runtime v2).
 *
 * Bridges the frozen HumanApprovalPrompter contract to a file-backed
 * decision exchange plus an optional notifier, so approvals can be
 * granted from outside the interactive terminal (via `omc graph
 * approvals decide`, and later via notification reply channels).
 *
 * Protocol (all files live inside the contained run directory):
 *   <runDir>/approvals/pending/<activationId>.json    written by the gate
 *   <runDir>/approvals/decisions/<activationId>.json  written by a decider
 *
 * Fail-closed by construction, mirroring createStdinApprovalGate:
 *   - malformed or unknown decisions never resolve a request (the gate
 *     keeps waiting for a well-formed one)
 *   - an expired request resolves to the configured timeout policy
 *     (default: denied)
 *   - decision artifacts carry no trust: the runner records the outcome
 *     in its own journal, so a forged decision file can only flip a
 *     human-approval node, exactly like typing y at the stdin prompt
